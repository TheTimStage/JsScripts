# JsScripts - API Docs
### JavaScript Scripting Mod for Game Events · Fabric 1.21.8

JsScripts is a powerful and flexible tool for your server, allowing you to create lore events, automation, and simple script logic using JavaScript.  
You can write code **directly in the game** using the built‑in JavaScript editor.

---

## 📁 Script Location

All scripts are stored in the server configuration directory:

```
config/jsscripts/
```

---

# 🔰 ScriptAPI Basics

## **log(message)**
Prints a message to the server console.

```js
log("Script started");
```

---

## **scriptType("once" | "loop")**
Defines when and how the script executes.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **once** | Executes once and then unloads |
| **loop** | Runs every server tick |

```js
scriptType("loop");
```

---
## scriptEnd()

Forcibly terminates the current script.
After calling this function, the script is fully unloaded from the ScriptEngine: all event handlers, onLoop handlers, and scheduled tasks (wait, every, repeat) are removed. No further code lines will execute.

### Example:
```
if (player.getHealth() <= 0) {
    log("Script terminated because player is dead");
    scriptEnd();
}
``````
---

## **on(event, handler)**
Registers a JavaScript event handler.

```js
on("playerJoin", p => msg(p, "Welcome!"));
```

---

## **onLoop(handler)**
Runs every tick if the script type is `loop`.

---

# ⏳ Scheduler

## **wait(ticks, fn)**
Execute a callback after N ticks.

## **delay(ticks, fn)**
Alias of `wait`.

## **repeat(count, fn(index))**
Execute several times, once per tick.

## **every(ticks, fn)**
Repeat execution every N ticks.

```js
every(40, () => log("2 seconds passed"));
```
